## Introduction

*Project Title:* Student Feedback Analysis  
*Created By:* [Sachin-Analyst](https://github.com/Sachin-Analyst)  
*Tools Used:* Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Google Colab 
*Focus Areas:* Data analysis, data visualization, and performance improvement.

## Project Description

- This report presents an in-depth analysis of student feedback data collected to evaluate and enhance a course. The feedback was gathered from over 1,000 students and covers various aspects of the course, such as the instructor's subject expertise, teaching methodology, course structure, and overall relevance.

- The main objective is to address low student satisfaction by identifying the specific areas that received the lowest feedback ratings. The analysis aims to pinpoint which aspects, like course content or instructor support, are most negatively impacting the students' overall experience.

## Installation 

Installation of Google Colab is simple and doesn't require any prior setup or software installation from a website. As a cloud-based service, you only need a Google account and a web browser to access it.

To explore or modify this analysis:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Sachin-Analyst/FUTURE_DS_03.git](https://github.com/Sachin-Analyst/FUTURE_DS_03.git)
    ```

2.  **Open the notebook:**
    -   Search for **Google Colab** in your web browser or navigate directly to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com/).
    -   Log in with your Google account.
    -   You can then upload and open the `Student_Feedback_analysis.ipynb` file from the repository, or connect your Google Drive to access it if you saved a copy there. The notebook contains all the necessary code for data analysis and visualization.

## Methodology

This project utilized descriptive research methods to understand the data and identify key trends. The work was done using **Google Colab** with the **pandas library** for data manipulation and **matplotlib and seaborn** for data visualization. The raw data, collected from over 1,000 students, included feedback on eight different categories, such as the instructor's subject knowledge, use of presentations, course structure, and assignment difficulty. An **"Overall_Satisfaction"** score was calculated for each student by averaging their ratings across these categories.

---

## Findings & Implications

Based on the analysis, the event received a moderate overall satisfaction score of **5.71 out of 10**.

### Key Strengths

* The instructor's strong subject knowledge was a key strength, receiving the highest average rating of **7.50**. This suggests that students found the content and delivery of the material to be accurate and reliable.

### Areas for Improvement

* The **lowest rated areas** were related to the practical and support aspects of the course. The lowest rated category was **"Degree of difficulty of assignments" (5.43)**, followed by "Solves doubts willingly" with an average score of **5.47**.
* The analysis indicates a **gap between the theoretical content and its practical application**.

## Visualizations

The project includes several visualizations to present the findings.

* **Average Ratings Bar Chart**: This chart displays the mean ratings for each feedback category, clearly showing that "Well versed with the subject" had the highest rating, while "Degree of difficulty of assignments" had the lowest. 
* **Radar Chart**: A radar chart provides a quick overview of all the average ratings. 
* **Correlation Matrix Heatmap**: This heatmap visualizes the correlation between different feedback categories and overall satisfaction, highlighting the areas with the highest impact on student happiness.
